Bubble Sort - compares 2 values at a time to get all values in an array sorted. 
Selection Sort - Compares the minimum and the first index value then make a swap if necessary. if the first index value is > the min value, the swap is done and the next value is compared until its done sorting. 
Insertion Sort - does not swap but shift values to make room for the appropriate value at a particular index.
